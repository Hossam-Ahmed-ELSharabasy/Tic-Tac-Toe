  ## How to Play
- The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns to enter their moves.
- On each turn, the player will be prompted to enter the row and column number (both 1-based indices) to place their mark (X or O).
- The game will check for a win or draw condition after each move.
- The game ends when one player wins or the grid is full, resulting in a draw.
